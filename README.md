This project is a web-based Sorting Algorithm Visualizer designed to help users understand various sorting algorithms through interactive visualization. Users can select from algorithms like Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, and Quick Sort. The application generates a random array of numbers, which is visually represented as bars, allowing users to observe the sorting process in real time. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the visualizer provides an engaging way to learn about algorithm efficiency and behavior, making it an excellent educational tool for students and programming enthusiasts.
